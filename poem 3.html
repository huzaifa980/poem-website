                <h3>In a land of dreams and endless fun,</h3>
                <p>In a land of dreams and endless fun,<br>
                    Lived a kid, bright as the sun.<br> </p>
                   <p> With laughter and friends, every day was a race,<br>
                    Exploring, learning, a smile on their face.</p>
                <p>They swung and slid in the playground's delight,<br>
                    Imagination soared to incredible height. <br></p>
                    <p>
                        Numbers and stories filled their young mind,<br>
                      With dreams and wonders yet to find. <br></p>

                    <p>
                        In the classroom, they chased their dreams,<br>
                     With passion and curiosity, bursting at the seams. <br> </p>
                     <p>
                        They wrote, they learned, they aimed for the sky,<br>
                     Their spirit shining, ready to fly. <br> </p>
                     <p>
                        So keep on learning, little one,<br>
                      Embrace the world, bask in the sun. <br> </p>
                      <p>
                        You're brave, you're strong, and filled with bliss,<br>
                      Unleash your greatness, and find pure bliss. <br>
                      </p>
