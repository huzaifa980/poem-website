                <h3>In a classroom filled with joy and cheer,</h3>
                <p>
                    In a classroom filled with joy and cheer, <br>
                  Class three kids, oh, how they appear! <br> </p>
                  <p>
                    Counting numbers, learning with delight, <br>
                   Imaginations soaring, reaching new height. <br></p>
                   <p>
                    Books and colors, their passions ignite, <br>
                    Creating art, a beautiful sight. <br>
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Playing in the sun, friendships bloom, <br>
                    Innocence and laughter, filling every room. <br>
                   </p>
                <p>
                    Class three kids, full of wonder and glee, <br>
                   Chasing dreams, so wild and free. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep learning, exploring, never shy, <br>
                Class three kids, reach for the sky! <br>
